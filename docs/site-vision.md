# karolbuczek.com — Vision & Positioning

## Purpose of this site

This site is my **portfolio and interactive resume**.

- TallKarol.com = studio/services, client-facing.
- KarolBuczek.com = **me as an individual operator**: projects, case studies, and a resume that feels like a living product.

The site should make it easy to:

1. Skim my experience in **under 30 seconds**.
2. Dive into **case studies** that show real problems, constraints, and outcomes.
3. Explore an **interactive resume** that feels modern (timelines, filters, visual structure, motion).

## Primary audiences

1. **Hiring managers & tech leads**
   - Looking for a full-stack dev / frontend dev / growth engineer hybrid.
   - Want to see: code thinking, system design, collaboration with marketing/ops.

2. **Founders / CMOs / business owners**
   - Considering me for consulting or part-time product/tech roles.
   - Want to see: business outcomes, marketing + tech alignment, reliability.

## High-level goals

- Present me as:
  - **Builder:** I ship working systems, not just slides.
  - **Translator:** I can talk to founders, marketers, and engineers.
  - **Operator:** I’ve owned funnels, ads, infra migrations, and internal tools.

- Make it **feel like a modern app**, not a static brochure:
  - Smooth animations and micro-interactions.
  - Filterable resume / case studies (e.g., by “Dev”, “Marketing”, “Systems”, “AI”).
  - Time-based or system-based views of my work.

## Design & UX energy

- Overall vibe: **calm, confident, modern** — not shouty agency vibes.
- Motion should feel:
  - Purposeful and smooth (no gimmicky overload).
  - Used to **reveal hierarchy and structure** (e.g., sections sliding, counters, timelines).
- Layout should be:
  - Clean and readable.
  - Friendly for both desktop and mobile.
  - Hero + scrollable narrative sections.

## Content priorities

1. **Case studies over buzzwords**
   - Each case study should tell: context → constraints → system/solution → outcome.
   - Screenshots, diagrams, and quick bullets.

2. **Interactive resume**
   - Timeline of roles and projects with filters (e.g., “Show only developer work”).
   - Call out cross-disciplinary work: infra migrations, A/B testing, internal tools.

3. **Clear calls to action**
   - “View interactive resume”
   - “Browse case studies”
   - “Get in touch” (email / LinkedIn)

## Tone guidelines

- Honest and specific, not over-inflated.
- Use plain language; explain acronyms when needed.
- Show personality in small doses (microcopy, section titles), but keep overall tone professional.
