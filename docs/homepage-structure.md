# Homepage — Content & Interaction Outline

This is the **starting point**. I want to get something live fast, then deepen it.

## Sections (first version)

### 1. Hero — Name, Tagline, Primary CTA

**Goal:** In ~5 seconds, someone knows who I am, what I do, and where to click next.

Suggested content:

- Main heading (H1):
  - "Karol Buczek"
- Subheading:
  - "Full-stack developer & systems-minded marketer."
- Short one-liner:
  - "I build web apps, internal tools, and growth systems that solve real business problems."
- Primary CTA:
  - Button: “View interactive resume”
- Secondary CTA:
  - Button: “Browse case studies”

**Interaction ideas:**

- Subtle entrance animation on text + buttons.
- Background could have a **low-key animated system map** / nodes / lines to imply connectivity and systems thinking.

### 2. Snapshot Strip — Quick Stats / Credibility

**Goal:** Give fast proof points without overwhelming.

Examples:

- “20+ years coding”
- “15+ years in marketing & growth”
- “Built tools for lead management, infra migrations, and internal workflows”
- “Worked with startups, manufacturers, and national home-services brands”

Layout: horizontal pills or small cards with light motion on hover.

### 3. Featured Case Studies

**Goal:** Tease 2–3 key projects with strong outcomes and let users click in.

Each card might include:

- Title (e.g., “Rebuilt lead pipeline and web stack for national home-services brand”)
- Role tags (Dev, Systems, Marketing)
- 1–2 line summary
- A small metric or outcome (conversion lift, efficiency, etc.) where available.
- CTA: “Open case study”

Interaction ideas:

- Cards animate slightly on hover.
- Tag filters (optional v1) to narrow by Dev / Marketing / Systems / AI etc.

### 4. Interactive Resume Preview

**Goal:** Introduce the resume as a product, not a PDF.

Content:

- Short explanation:
  - “Instead of a static PDF, this is a resume you can explore — filter by role type, skim a timeline, or dive into systems I’ve built.”
- Simple embedded component / toggle:
  - Tabs: **Timeline | Skills Map | Highlights**
  - In v1, this can be a static preview with a CTA button: “Open full resume”.

---

### 5. Skills & Systems Map

**Goal:** Show the blend of development, marketing, and systems work.

Ideas for layout:

- Grid or radial map of capabilities:
  - **Build:** Web apps, internal tools, automations.
  - **Operate:** Lead funnels, experiments, campaigns.
  - **Connect:** Integrations, infra migrations, multi-tool stacks.
- Don’t list every tech here; focus on **categories** and what problems I solve.

---

### 6. “How I Work” / Philosophy

Short narrative section answering:

- How I approach problems.
- What working with me feels like.
- Biases (shipping, maintainability, clear communication).

Example copy:

> I like messy, real problems — broken lead flows, outdated systems, teams stuck between marketing and engineering. My default is to understand the constraints, sketch the system, then ship something small and useful fast.

### 7. Contact / CTA

Simple, direct:

- “Want to talk about a role or a project?”
- Buttons:
  - “Email me”
  - “Connect on LinkedIn”
