## Roles I’m optimising this site for

- Full-Stack Developer / Senior Frontend
- Marketing Engineer / Martech Developer
- Technical Product / Growth Engineer hybrid
- Occasional consulting / fractional head of web or growth for the right brands

## How I like the site to "sound"

- Direct, clear, and a bit playful.
- Strong bias toward **outcomes** (metrics, before/after, systems that work).
- No vague “disruption” talk, more: *“here’s what we built, why, and what changed.”*
